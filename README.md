# TODO

Decide if i want this to be a full fledged cms
Decide if I want to work on the Django tutorial in tandem so if I get stuck I can swap back and forth?

Draw up wireframes for the whole app, and figure out all of the react companents
Design the entire api
Consider balsamiq
Consider installing Windows


# Version 1 Features

* Be able to without logging in, use the tomato timer and a single todo list stored locally (same features from the original version)

* Once logged in, be able to create projects and add tasks to the lists

# Version 2 Features

* Habit tracking

Floss
Eat x number of veggies
wake up by 7am
go to bed by 11pm
stream today
took a walk today
start evening stream by 6pm

I wilt at 9pm, so start stream at 6pm if I want 3 hours



# Reasons for making

* Practice my stack
* Figure out my process for building things
* Make the task management system I want myself
* Potentially sell it if it is useful enough
* People wanted to be able to use the old tomatoes together again, and it was broken

# Architecture

* ReactJS/React Native
* Typescript
* Browserify
* Python 3
* Django/Django Rest Framework
* Django Channels/Socket.io for websocket stuff


Make it so that you can enter your distracting communication website into the app and it will show that site only during the tomato break
Slack, Gmail, Hangouts

Free version can be just the tomato timer, and you can create todo lists but not save them other than in local storage
Paid version adds todo lists/projects, tagging things, saving how many tomatoes you have done, stats and graphs
I want to make the tool that will help me create more apps and maybe it will be helpful to other people too

Make it easy to download your data
Make it open source and say if you want to have the full version without paying, you can set it up yourself

This app may also allow me to focus more while working if I put the twitch chat into the system

Use twitch streams for marketing
