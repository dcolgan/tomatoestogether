Things to remember before streaming:
    Don't brainstorm for too long or you will be worn out

Why did David suddenly get tired of working?
    Is it he tried too long to think of a good idea and couldn't
    It is 5pm or whatever time it is
    Is it because he worked for 6 hours

I got into a trying out ideas in my head rut


Folders of projects
Projects have nested tasks
You can do a tomato on a project
You can schedule tasks
