Help me maintain my online relationships and still get work done



I have a completely disorganized life, and I want to stop feeling overwhelmed and out of control of my time.
I want to stay connected with people but still get work done.
If this app could solve my internet surfing addiction, that would be great.

David S Colgan is a small business developer who wants to keep better track of his time.

Theory: If I track more of my time with the tomato timer, I will get more done because there will be more structure, accountability, and visibility of what I've done.

I also have a very short memory and can't remember what I did yesterday.

I feel like I'm never "working enough" and never getting anything done/making progress.
I hate recording my life explicitly (journaling).

You tell people what you are working on right now, and then talk about it during the break.

"Accountability is great if you are doing well, and if you are not doing well, you disappear." - Ramit Sethi
If the accountability is very small and self-contained to a tomato, maybe that could solve this issue.

If you didn't do well this tomato, try another one.

I also feel like I'm always forgetting things, and I don't want to forget things.
    I'll have ideas that I want to capture but I'm at the gym and don't want to bring a notebook with me or at the grocery store.

Tomatoes together will help you:
Get the man/woman of your dreams
Never forget anything ever again

Help organize your stuff

Option 1: There are no lists at all
    Everything is just thrown in a giant pile
    In order to find something you have to look at everything in your pile

Option 2: There is a tag for every possible task, and the only task tagged with that tag is the one that it is

Option 3: Put some todo items under the same tag/heading

What do I want the system to tell me

# User stories

David has many pieces of information.  He wants to see them all from a 1000 mile birdseye view, and easily search for things.
David has a great idea.  He whips out his mobile phone device and taps the icon for the app.  He then clicks the "idea capture" icon, and speaks the idea into the phone and it records it.  Then the app shows him a bunch of tags and he taps all the relevant ones.



It is the morning.  David has a full 8 hours of work time available, and has no idea what to do next. He whips out TomatoesTogether.com and it tells him immediately what to do today?

David knows he gets stuff done, but can't remember any of it.  So when asked by the cute barista at the coffee shop "what did you do this weekend?" he has no idea what to say until he leaves the coffee shop and suddenly remembers everything.  If only he had an app that he could whip out and show the barista.

David has a bunch of data in his pile of things and he needs to organize them.  He whips out TomatoesTogether and starts organizing.

David has like 4 online communities that he wants to be talking in all day long.  But if he does that he never gets any work done.

David is a streamer who is doing a thing that needs some explanation, but if he only explains it one time, then new people come in who haven't heard the explanation.  He whips out TomatoesTogether.com and makes a FAQ list.

David is working and suddenly hits something that is the tinest littlest bit difficult.  His soft millenial brain can't handle the difficulty and immediately cries out for a reddit/facebook/twitter/youtube.  He knows he should resist and keep doing important life things, but his soft millenial brain refuses.  Instead, before his crisis point occurs, he whips out TomatoesTogether.com and it shows on his screen at all times what he is doing right now, and what he will do next and what he's already finished.

David is live streaming on twitch.tv and someone comes into the stream and says "what the crap is happening here" and David says "my good sir and/or madam, please to be referring to the big ol list on the screen of what I'm doing and/or will have been being done by me and will in fact be doing heretofore.

David's life is in shambles.  He needs a life management system, but can't be bothered in the least to learn emacs and also org mode.  He needs something simple.

David wants to stream on twitch.tv and create an app called tomatoes together.  But he also wants to interact with the chat.  But when he tries to work and also talk to the chat, chat tries to get him to install better twitch tv and interrupts his flow of thought.
