Heuristic for what to do with your time:
Only do things that will still have relevance in the morning.
Reading reddit will not have relevance in the morning
Streaming
Gym
Eating healthy
Cleaning the apartment
Reading books
Doing the laundry
will have relevance in the morning




Ideas to try for next time:
Talk a walk during lunch instead of staying on stream
Take off 2 hours in the middle of the day

If I hit a wall, I need to make sure I don't keep banging my head against it
Identify walls that are hit, and instead of continuing, make a note and research it more later, and do something else

        You can start tomatoes
    Stats


    Collect ideas - all new things first go to the inbox which looks like a workflowy document
    Assign trees of ideas to projects
    Other people who want to assign things to you have to add them to your inbox and can't directly add them to your projects

Nested projects
    Any project can be used as your tomato task
        You can start a timer while you are working on things
        Start a tomato while working on things
        The system automatically tracks which tasks you finish during tomatoes and during time tracking sessions

    A task can have comments and you can share projects with other people, but during a tomato it hides all of that from you so you aren't interrupted

Nested tasks inside of projects
Contexts/hashtags/settings/scenarios
Calendar
    Reminders and due dates (any task)

Stats/Review
    Graphs of tomatoes done per day per hour per whatever
