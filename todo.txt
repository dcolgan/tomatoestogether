"Life Management System"
Idea capture - never forget anything
Assistance with what to do next, and breaking that down into manageable chunks
Assitance with distraction by the internet
Reminders for time sensitive things
Track my progress so I can see where I've come from
Plan

Make the entirety of your life's tasks not seem so enormous
Instead of thinking in terms of days and weeks and months and years, think in terms of minutes and hours.
